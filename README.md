Idk how I beat the blocking stuff btw

The Mc edition comes with a text file with a url for mc 1.8 in it. .exy is just a goofy .txt file. if you want to save a blocked url to ur computer clone the mc stuff and replace everything with the websites info.
treat these exy files as text files and not actual exy files. Its suppose to look cool
